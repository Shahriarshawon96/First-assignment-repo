            <p> Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the
                scenes to
                make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

                Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use
                depends on the
                types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.

                Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great
                career
                option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional
                university
                degree to become qualified.</p> <br>

                    A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They
                    take
                    an idea from the drawing board and turn it into reality.

                <p>The backend developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes. This is where the data is stored,
                    and
                    without this data, there would be no frontend. The backend of the web consists of the server that
                    hosts
                    the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data.

                <p> My goal is a full stack developer.Full-stackers take care of both the front-end and the back-end,
                    and
                    need to know how the web works on all levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides
                    will relate. Naturally working up to this level of expertise will take longer, as there is more to
                    learn.</p>
